# RLIG (Required Ligatures) Test for Adobe Illustrator

## The problem

In my testing, it seems that Adobe Illustrator does not support the `rlig` OpenType feature. 

This is as of Illustrator v26.0, which is the oldest version my Creative Cloud app will seem to let me download.

There are indications that `rlig` *did* work as of 2020, so this may be a regression.
